# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)
The concept of our project is based on a vide game called rainbow six siege and its a bit easier because not only are we going to be the creators we also know the user side as well because these are things we want to see and be able to do. We know there is already a major stat website released by the creators of the game but we want to make one that is easier to use with some more simple ideas as well as an addition of some other concepts like tips for operators and even maybe map sight set ups. Our program should give you basic stats on how you preform during a match or previous matches, it can also tie into the operators you play and the maps those games took place on.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
Some technologies that are going to be needed involve a coding langauge for us that will be python mainly. We also might use some c within our project.
