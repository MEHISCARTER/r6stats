# Introduction

The concept of our project is based on a vide game called rainbow six siege and its a bit easier because not only are we going to be the creators we also know the user side as well because these are things we want to see and be able to do. We know there is already a major stat website released by the creators of the game but we want to make one that is easier to use with some more simple ideas as well as an addition of some other concepts like tips for operators and even maybe map sight set ups. Our program should give you basic stats on how you preform during a match or previous matches, it can also tie into the operators you play and the maps those games took place on. There is an official website to get your stats tracked for this game but the company has been slowly building up trust issues and reliability over the years so our web app should be simpler while still providing good information. With the company starting to lose trust we want our web site to be as user friendly as possible so they can have something to trust and be confident in that will work.

- Retreive stats for multiple occurences like map, operator, match, site
- Provide infromation based on the user input
- allow users to input information
- allow users to easily move around website

# Anticipated Technologies

Some technologies that are going to be needed involve a coding langauge for us that will be python mainly. We also might use some C and SQL database within our project. Another technology that can be used is Django the python web framework since we plan on this being a web application.

# Method/Approach

One plan we have is to be very felxible so we can attack all angles of this project when needed. We are planning on using the agile method we hope for our approach to be based on being very user friendly. 

# Estimated Timeline

- Finish presentation before October 8th
- Finish UML diagram before October 9th
- Start coding week of October 14th
- Set up sprints for weeks to come during the week of October 14th

# Anticipated Problems

One main problem we are looking at is making it possible for our code to go out and grab infromation and bring that back to show our users.

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
